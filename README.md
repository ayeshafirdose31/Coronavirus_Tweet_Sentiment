The COVID-19 pandemic is a global outbreak of the coronavirus, an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.

The first cases of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) were first detected in China in December 2019, with the virus quickly spreading to other countries around the world. This led the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and to designate the outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 2 million people have died from the disease in the European region.

Sentiment analysis of tweets related to the coronavirus can provide valuable insights into public opinion and perception of the virus. It can be used to track changes in sentiment over time, identify influential users and groups, and identify specific issues or concerns related to the virus. However, it is important to note that sentiment analysis is not a straightforward task and results may vary depending on the dataset, pre-processing and modeling used. Sentiment analysis of tweets can be challenging due to informal language, use of slang and emoticons, and the presence of sarcasm and irony.
